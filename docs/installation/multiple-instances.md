# Install additional SQL Agent instances

## New installation

If additional agents are needed after installing the initial SQL Agent, repeat the [Install the SQL Agent](new-installation.md#install-the-sql-agent). The installation package will automatically transform to install new instances of the agent. After installing each new instance, define a new machine in OpCon with a unique name and port number using the procedure for [Machine creation](new-installation.md#machine).

# SQLAgent.ini file configuration

The SQLAgent.ini is the SQL Agent configuration file name. The location of the SQLAgent.ini file is in the <Configuration Directory\>\\SQLAgent\\ directory.

:::note
The Configuration Directory is based on where you installed your programs. For more information, refer to [File Locations](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/core/rolling/Files/Concepts/File%20Locations.htm) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

The following settings are critical to the operation of the agent with OpCon:

- **MaximumNumberOfJobs**: This value determines the maximum number of jobs the agent is allowed to process concurrently.
- **SocketNumberToSAM**: This value is used for communication between the agent and the SMANetCom; consequently, the value for this  setting and the value for the Socket Number on the Machines screen in the Enterprise Manager must match.
- **JORSSocket**: This value defines the socket number through which the JORS Service communicates; consequently, the value for this setting and the value for the JORS Port Number in the Advanced Machine Properties screen in the Enterprise Manager must match.

## Modify the SQLAgent.ini file

1. Right-click on the **Start** button.
2. Select **Explore** from the menu.
3. Browse to <Configuration Directory\>\\SQLAgent\\ for the desired SQL Agent instance.
4. Find the **SQLAgent.ini** file.
5. Right-click the file and select **Open With**.
6. Select an ASCII text editor (e.g., Notepad) from the **Choose the program you want use** list box.
7. In the text editor, make any necessary modifications to the .ini file. For complete information on the SQLAgent.ini settings, refer to the related topics.
8. Use menu path: **File \> Save**.
9. **Close â˜’** the text editor.

## General settings

The table contains the basic settings for the SQL Agent.

|[General Settings]|Default|Dynamic|Required|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|DisplayServiceName|SMA OpCon Agent for SQL|N|Y|The service name displayed in the Service Control Manager. The name must be unique for each SQL Agent. Do not change this unless there is more than one agent on this physical machine.|
|ShortServiceName|SMA_SQLNET|N|Y|The hidden, internal (i.e., registry) service name SQL refers to. The name must be unique for each SQL Agent. Do not change this unless there is more than one agent on this physical machine.|
|MaximumNumberOfJobs|50|Y|Y|Defines the maximum number of jobs the agent can simultaneously manage. When setting the MaximumNumberOfJobs, consider the SQL Agent machine's processor speed and memory (RAM) size. No job is processed when this setting is 0. Although the maximum value allowed is 500, typical customer usage ranges from 10 to 30 jobs.|
|InitializationScript|Blank|N|N|The full path to the initialization script. The initialization script executes when the SQL Agent service starts. SMA Technologies recommends using this script to map network drives or to perform any other required initialization procedure. Enclose the path in double quotes ("*path*").|
|TerminationScript|Blank|N|N|The full path to the termination script. The termination script executes when the SQL Agent service stops. SMA Technologies recommends using this script to disconnect network drives or to perform any other required termination procedure. Enclose the path in double quotes ("*path*").|

## TCP/IP parameters

The table contains the network settings for the SQL Agent.

:::caution
Enter all alphabetic TCP/IP parameter values in uppercase. The SQL Agent service does not start if the values are in lowercase.
:::

|[TCP/IP Parameters]|Default|Dynamic|Required|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|SocketNumberToSAM|21100|N|Y|Defines the socket number through which the agent and the SMANetCom communicate. This number must match the Machine's socket number defined in the Enterprise Manager. If there are multiple agents installed on one machine, each agent must have a unique value. For an up-to-date list of unused ports, please refer to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority at www.iana.org.|
|AllowedIPAddress_1|ANY|Y|N|Determines if communication from the SMANetCom to the agent is restricted to one or more TCP/IP addresses.  If ANY is specified, the agent accepts communication from any TCP/IP address. If a specific TCP/IP address is defined (e.g., 126.40.90.231), the agent only accepts communication from the specified address. The agent refuses a connection if communication is attempted from another address. This definition enhances communication security by refusing communications from other TCP/IP addresses. If multiple SAMs are on a network, this address ensures the agent is only accepting messages from the intended SMANetCom. This parameter is case-sensitive.|
|AllowedIPAddress_2|Blank|Y|N|Same as Address_1 explanation.|
|AllowedIPAddress_3|Blank|Y|N|Same as Address_1 explanation.|
|AllowedIPAddress_4|Blank|Y|N|Same as Address_1 explanation.|

## Debug options

The table contains the log and trace settings for troubleshooting the SQL Agent.

|[Debug Options]|Default|Dynamic|Required|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|ArchiveDaysToKeep|10|Y|N|Determine how many archive folders should be retained. Each time it archives a log, the SQL Agent checks for expired archive folders to delete.|
|MaximumLogFileSize|150000|Y|N|Sets the maximum size in bytes for each agent log file. Prevents the accumulation of log messages in a single file. This is a site-specific setting.|
|TraceLevel|0|Y|N|Determines the detail in the information written to the SQLAgent.log file. 0 is standard logging level. 1 is more detailed logging.|
|TraceSAMMessages|ON|Y|N|Enables/Disables tracing of SMANetCom communication messages sent to/from the agent. The SQLAgentTrace.log file contains the traced messages. If ON, the incoming SMANetCom messages are traced. If OFF, the incoming SMANetCom messages are not traced. This parameter is case-sensitive. Note: This trace file is helpful for troubleshooting and debugging.|

## JORS settings

The table contains settings for configuring JORS for job output retrieval.

|[JORS Settings]|Default|Dynamic|Required|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|JORSSocket|21110|N|Y|Defines the socket number through which the JORS Service communicates. This number must match the JORS Port Number defined in the Enterprise Manager under the Advanced Machine Settings in the Communication Settings category. If there are multiple SQL Agents installed on one machine, each agent's JORS Service must have a unique port. For an up-to-date list of unused ports, please refer to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority at www.iana.org.|
|MaxJorsFileSize|65536|N|N|Indicates the maximum size of Job Output file that will be retrieved for viewing in OpCon. If the output file is larger than the MaxJorsFile Size, it will be truncated while viewing. The minimum and default value for this is 65536 bytes (which is 64K) and maximum value is 52428800 bytes (which is 50MB). If an invalid value is specified, the file will default to 65536.|
|LogComposition|MIX|N|N|LogComposition only applies when a job output file larger than the MaxJorsFileSize is being viewed. START indicates that MaxJorsFileSize bytes from start of the job output file will be presented in OpCon.  END indicates that MaxJorsFileSize bytes at the end of the job output file will be presented in OpCon. MIX indicates that half of MaxJorsFileSize bytes from the start of the file and half of MaxJorsFileSize bytes at the end of the job output file will be presented in OpCon.|
